# Lena as a Leader
*This [repo](https://github.com/LenaAnneKrug/lena-as-a-leader) allows anyone to submit a PR against it, that is on purpose*

[See it prettier](https://bit.ly/lenaannekrug-as-a-leader)

## My Availability
* Look at my calendar, it is generally 98% accurate
* Feel entirely free to put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want
* Grab me when it's urgent
* If you need me and can't find me:
	* Slack Me
	* Text/Call Me
* We are all very busy, but supporting you and enabling, empowering, unblocking you is my number one priority

## Direct Responsibility Individual
* I believe strongly in this principle
* Everything should have a single owner who is responsible and someone who is accountable
* If you are responsible for something and are not going to be available, it is your responsibility to make sure someone is responsible 
for you
* If you are accountable it is your role to make sure the team is focused and following process and standards

## More Working Code Principle
* We do stuff that works (it works as expected)
* We do stuff that gets used (has a job, is working)
* We do stuff that provides a benefit (it's working for us, it provides measurable value, or informs us to why it's not)

## Blameless, But Still Responsible
* We should have no fear in trying new things, or fixing older things
	* If we do the process is broken, let me know we'll fix it
* It is ok to fail and to learn
* It is ok to point out when someone has made a mistake or error, I favor candid feedback that is done respectfully
* See DRI above, if you own something, you are responsible for it
* It is my job to provide a culture that enables autonomy and empowerement

## Autonomy and Empowerement
* I beleive in [Enabling Bureaucracy](https://www.solutionsiq.com/resource/blog-post/enabling-bureaucracy/)
* Teams and Individuals need guardrails in the form expectations, standards, and practices
* These allow teams to be autonomous and empowered

## Feedback
* I like feedback, in both directions
* However these are important:
	* Safety - it is unlikely that anything negative will occur for giving feedback
	* Effort - the feedback process should not result in arguing, but in honest open discussion
	* Benefit - feedback should have an outcome, something that will result in change or indicates why it doesn't

## One-on-One Meetings
* These meetings are important
* They should not be status updates, they should be us strategizing and unlocking you
* I will most likely have some topics to discuss as well
* I will use this time to coach, mentor, and to find opportunities to sponsor

## My Job
* I am currently VP, Platform Engineering at Meetup
	* See my [Job Role Description](https://github.com/meetup/engineering-roles/blob/master/managers/vp_platform_engineering.md)
* Build and hire a strong team that is highly effective
* Grow and foster everyone here
* Provide Context and prioritization
* Set clear expectations
* Be the final decision maker when needed
* To insure we are executing and operating in a way that is working
* Eliminate waste and focus us on things that add value
* Provide clear mission and strategy

## Me
* I care about you
* I care about results
* I don't believe in blockers (things can always be unblocked)
* I believe in small things that make big things
* I believe in continous improvement no matter how small
* I beleive in [Enabling Bureaucracy](https://www.solutionsiq.com/resource/blog-post/enabling-bureaucracy/)
* I believe in daily goal setting
* I believe in transparency
* I believe in the honesty and focus of seeing what we are doing routinely (Retros)
* I like to be on time, though not always possible
* I only believe in two priorities
	* High - What I need to do right now
	* What I might do next
* I will never lie to you, however I may defer the truth because of legal or privacy reasons and I will make that clear

## Work Hours
* Follow company guidelines, but also:
* Get stuff done, deliver on our goals
* Be there when your team needs you

## How are you doing
* You will know, I will tell you
* However I think there are three stages
	* You are meeting your current goals
	* You are struggling to meet your goals
	* You are underwater and are in trouble, and we need to have a serious conversation, but this should never be a surprise
	* NOTE: I did not list exceeding current goals because if you are, I think we should applaud that, celebrate it and reset your goals
	* NOTE 2: Goals also include improving or growing yourself and career

## What (I think) I'm Good At
* Focusing on the next right/best thing
* Setting Strategy and Vision
* Building Lean Culture
* Big picture
* Dismantling blockers
* Listening
* Making Decisions
* Helping you make decisions
* Coaching & Mentoring in your work life and beyond
